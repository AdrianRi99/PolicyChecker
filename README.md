## **ðŸ’¡ About the Project**

PolicyChecker was designed to simplify the analysis and review of contracts. By identifying critical contract elements, the app helps users make informed decisions and minimize legal risks.
The app is particularly useful for common contract types such as employment contracts, rental agreements, purchase contracts, etc., and it detects both essential contract information and clauses that may be problematic or unlawful.
